# Deep Learning

Built my own deep learning framework (e.g Tensorflow/PyTorch) to help me learn the basics better. 

Implemented backprop and calculated gradients by myself. Results are comparable to using pytorch and 
tensorflow after training.
- Only supports Relu and Sigmoid activation functions
- Only supports BinaryCrossEntropy and Mean Squared Error Loss functions


Bonus
- implemented dynamic learning rate adjustment
